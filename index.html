<h3>How the Web Works</h3>
<p>The web is a global network of computers that communicate with each other. The web is composed of many different files, 
but the majority of files are html pages. When a person goes to a web
  page like <a href="www.google.com">Google</a>, the Google computer sends
  a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>, the appropriate HTML document is
  sent back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em>
  parses the html content and tags to display the formatted page on the user's screen.

  does a good job of explaining.
</p>

<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.
</p>

<h3>Tags and Elements</h3>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <u><b>elements</b></u>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <u><b>tags</b></u>. The browser interprets
  the multiple tabs and spacess as one single space.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.
</p>

<h3>Why Computers are Literal</h3>
<p>Computers are literal because they interpret instructions
  exactly. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.
</p>

<h3>Inline vs Block Elements</h3>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them. Inline elements are normally displayed without line breaks like the bold and underline tags.
